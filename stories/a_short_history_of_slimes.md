# A Short History of Slimes

  Slimes are one of my favorite species; they make amazing pets and companions as long as you keep them fed and damp.
I found my first one while exploring a buried parking garage; it was the cutest yellow goo ball I have ever seen.
It seemed scared of me.
Having some rolled oats in my backpack, I scattered them on the ground in front of it, and it began eating.
After a few minutes, it was comfortable with me following it around.
Unfortunately, the gate was closing in a few hours, so I had to leave, but after that, I was obsessed with slimes.

  It would be more than two months before our shards would connect again; in that time I researched all I could about them, which wasn't much.
A few guides on hunting them and a recipe for slime stew was all I could find.
When I was finally able to return, I brought a big bag of oats.
This time, it seemed to recognize me and let me pat/pet her while she ate.
When I finally had to leave for the day, she followed me back, and we have been friends ever since.
She is currently sitting on my desk, digesting a few pages from my notebook as I write this.

  Her name is Noel.
I don't think they have genders, or at least not gender roles, but I still refer to her as female.
They leave a trail of slime wherever they go.
After my brother bugged me about needing to know how slimes taste I collected some of the trail and fried it.
It tasted like dirt.
I don't know why anyone would want to hunt them for food unless they were starving.
And even then, I certainly could not kill something so cute.

  As for size and life spans, no one has any idea.
I have had Noel for four years, and she does seem any older, but I can't really tell.
Noel is around 15 cm in diameter, and she does not get any bigger no matter how much I overfeed her.
The largest I have ever seen was about 70 cm, and the smallest was 5.
They can't see or hear but have an amazing sense of smell; their slime gives people a light tingle if they stay on you for too long.
But other than that, they are harmless.

  They eat plants and other decomposing organic debris, preferring the latter when it's available.
However, I have seen Noel seemingly consume ants and other bugs, but she didn't hunt; it just happened upon it.
  They are about as docile as creatures come; however, there was one disturbing article about a slime killing a hunter by wrapping itself around his face before climbing through his gasping mouth and suffocating him from the inside.
I believe this may be true, but I doubt it would happen unless someone tried to eat a slime alive.

  The origin of the slime species is uncertain; there are two theories that I know of.
The first one is mainly based on a page recovered from a pre-shatter archive (or library, as they were known at the time).
This page contains references to "making slime".
It is known that around this time they were able to synthetically grow various meats for consumption, so it is not a stretch to assume they could have engineered other organisms.

  The paper is incomplete, mostly destroyed by age and moisture, but it contains a few other interesting points.
They discussed children playing with slime.
Which might mean they were engineered to entertain children, which would explain their harmless and docile nature.
There is a reference to "slime-making kits".
One of the books on hunting slimes says that if you cut them in half, both halves will grow separately.
This means you could sell one half as a "slime-making kit", but I am not going to cut one in half to find out.


  I developed the second theory.
It involves slimes evolving from a moving eukaryotic mold.
In this theory, slimes were in a shard with a long delta time and no competition from animals.
This would mean their only competition was from each other and would allow them to be as docile and colorful as they are.
I think the color is a side effect of a unique scent that each type of slime produces the closest thing they have to a gender.
Telling each other whether they are genetically compatible.


  Whatever their origin, they certainly aren't monsters to be hunted, and they show more emotion than much of my family.

  Also, they taste shit... Anyway, I hope this gave prospective hunters second thoughts and anyone else a nice introduction to these lovely, squishy friends.
